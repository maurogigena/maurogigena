# Hi there! I'm Mauro 👋

## A passionate Front End Developer focused on design and functionality.

Welcome to my GitHub space, where I blend my love for coding with my creativity to craft appealing and functional user interfaces. With expertise in **JavaScript**, **React JS**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and a keen interest in continuously updating my skill set, I aim to push the boundaries of web development.

### A little more about me...

- 🌱 I recently graduated as a Front End Developer, but my journey doesn't stop here. I plan to keep learning new technologies to complement my front-end skills.
- ⚽ Passionate about football, I'm a proud supporter of Club Atlético Banfield. Besides coding, you can find me playing football or 🏀 basketball.
- 🏋️ This year, I've committed to changing my habits, so I started going to the gym five times a week; the weekends are reserved for my cravings 🍦🍕.
- 🥊 I love watching UFC, 🏀 NBA, and 🏆 the Argentine football league, immersing myself in the world of sports whenever I can.
- ✈️ Before diving into the tech world, I graduated as a Cabin Crew, which enriched my life with unique experiences and perspectives.
